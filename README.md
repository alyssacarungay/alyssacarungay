ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm @alyssacarungay
    I'm a recent computer science graduate from the University of Manitoba.
    I'm mostly comfortable writting code in Java and C but do have some experience with other languages as well.
    I'm currently learning more about full-stack web development
    and gaining new skills with Javascript
